## Comparison of Edge-Weighted Online Bipartite Matching and Offline Bipartite Matching using combinatorial optimization
To create a framework for selling various items on an online platform, we will develop an application that provides recommendations for the most suitable customer for a product, identifies the costliest product, finds the best supplier, calculates total sales, total sales price, and determines the maximum profit gained across all products.

## Tasks
* Implementation of Online Bipartite Matching Algorithm.<br/>
* Implementation of Offline Bipartite Matching Algorithm.<br/>
* Comparison of Online and Offline Bipartite Matching
Algorithm in terms of time complexity.
* To design and develop GUI for suppliers and customers
such that supplier can sell product to the customer who
is paying more for a particular item.<br/>

## Dependencies
Please install the following dependencies:<br/>
* tkinter<br/>
* numpy<br/>
* networkx<br/>
* pandas<br/>
* matplotlib<br/>

## Dataset
This dataset was compiled by collecting statistics from the
widely used Indian e-commerce platform. It is a component
of a comprehensive collection that was made that comprises
more than 26 items. This algorithm can be implemented in large scale.
